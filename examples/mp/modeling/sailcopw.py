# The company Sailco must determine how many sailboats to produce over several time periods,
# while satisfying demand and minimizing costs.
# The demand for the periods is known and an inventory of boats is available initially.
# In each period, Sailco can produce boats inside at a fixed cost per boat.
# Additional boats can be produced outside at a higher cost per boat.
# There is an inventory cost per boat per period.
# The business objective is to minimize the overall cost, which is the sum of the
# production cost and inventory cost.
# The production cost is modeled using a *piecewise-linear* function.
